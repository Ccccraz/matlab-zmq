matlab-zmq
==========

What's this all about?
----------------------

Quite simply, this will eventually be a complete ZMQ binding for MATLAB. Eventually, this project will include the
following:

+ Mex bindings for libzmq (core ZMQ API).
+ Using said Mex bindings, a "nicer" interface to ZMQ for use with MATLAB.

Getting Started
---------------
+ Make sure you have ZMQ 4.0.4 installed. Change settings in make.m to point to your installation. (NOTE: Windows has
not been tested. Mac and Linux should work).
+ Ensure you have mex configured
+ Run make.m

Can I help?
-----------

Yep -  pull requests, patches, comments, questions, concerns, outright abuse are welcome. I am working on this project
in my free time, which is limited, so if you are interested in helping I welcome your input.
